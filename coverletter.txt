Schmidt Ocean Institute Hiring Committee

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am writing to apply for the Data Solutions Engineer position at Schmidt Ocean Institute. With a Ph.D. in chemical oceanography (completion July 2025) and a specialization in data science, I bring a technical skill set focused on the stewardship, accessibility, and open sharing of oceanographic data. SOI’s commitment to public data, scientific collaboration, and advancing ocean exploration aligns closely with my experience and personal mission.

During my doctoral work at the University of Washington, I developed scalable, open-source tools for marine microbial metabolomics using R and Python in collaboration with existing pipelines. My background combines seagoing fieldwork, scientific computing, and metadata-centered data engineering. I’ve worked with diverse datasets including mass spectrometry, satellite altimetry, and in situ physical and biogeochemical profiles. In the process, I built tools to streamline their transformation into analysis-ready products via APIs, interactive web applications, and reproducible documents.

Key accomplishments relevant to this role include:

  - Developed a widely adopted R package for metabolomics data access, now used by Metabolomics Workbench and multiple labs worldwide that I recently rewrote in Python and published to PyPI.

  - Implemented a Python-based data framework using DuckDB and Parquet for scalable, FAIR-compliant storage and analysis of high-volume mass-spectrometry data.

  - Participated in five research cruises, once as chief scientist, and was a core part of post-expedition data curation and integration between labs.

My current work applies automation to oceanographic field data, with a focus on making complex environmental data intuitive and shareable in the same way that SOI values. I’ve worked with interdisciplinary teams to publish peer-reviewed papers as both first author and collaborator and contributed to open data repositories. I’m particularly enthusiastic about supporting SOI’s real-time data dissemination initiatives as well as opportunities to sail with the R/V Falkor (too) and support mission-critical scientific operations.

I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to SOI’s data stewardship and help advance your mission of collaborative ocean exploration. Thank you for considering my application and I look forward to the opportunity to speak further.

Sincerely,
William Kumler
