## Technical skills

- **Coding**: Ten years of experience in R. Expertise with full‑pipeline
  construction including data ingestion, tidying, analysis,
  visualization, and sharing via reproducible documents, interactive web
  applications, and R packages published to both CRAN and Bioconductor.
  Three years of experience with Python largely centered around
  reverse‑engineering mass‑spectrometry file formats. Recent experience
  with database management systems and HTML/CSS. Extensive collaboration
  with international groups via Github.

- **Scientific analysis**: Univariate and multivariate statistics with a
  focus on dimensionality reduction, permutational methods, false
  discovery rate estimation, and machine learning (regularized
  regression, random forests, autoencoders).

- **Fieldwork and ship time**: Estimated 50 days at sea across both
  multi‑week cruises and short‑term time series sampling, one cruise as
  chief scientist. Experience with cruise planning, CTD operations,
  float deployments and recoveries, incubations, and real‑time data
  ingestion and visualization. Two weeks of land‑based fieldwork
  involving sample collection and small‑volume chemostat‑style
  mesocosms.
